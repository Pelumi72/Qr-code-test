## My process

I started building the site by typing the HTML code first. When I got the order of the HTML code, I then went to style it with CSS. This was how I got the Desktop site. Then I worked on making the site responsive on a mobile since it had to designs and it is good to make any site mobile friendly since more people view websites on their phones than laptops and desktops. 

### Built with

- HTML Elements.
- CSS Properties.

### What I learned

I learnt about units used for sizes and their properties. Percentages are used for scalability, pixels for static images. Ems and rems are dynamic but not scalable. I also was able to use media query in a real project.

### Continued development

The areas I want to focus on now is making sites that have responsive sizes. I want to know if it is possible make a media query in which no matter the size of the screen the size of the element can be maintained as long as it doesn't affect it's readability.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.codeply.com/) - This helped me to properly see the effect of my media query without having to put check on a different device.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This resource helped me to properly research the elements I was able to use.
